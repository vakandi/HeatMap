The code above represents an HTML document that displays a proof of concept dashboard for managing datasets using the Google Maps Heatmap Layer.
The document starts with the usual <!doctype html> declaration and sets the language to English (<html lang="en">).
The <head> section contains meta information, including the character encoding (<meta charset="utf-8">) and the title of the web page (<title>).
External stylesheets and scripts are included for Bootstrap and jQuery, similar to the previous code snippet.
The Bootstrap stylesheets are loaded from CDNs (<link rel="stylesheet">).
The jQuery library is loaded from a CDN (<script>).
The Bootstrap JavaScript file is also loaded from a CDN (<script>).
The <body> section begins with a <div> container (<div class="container">) to hold the content.
Inside the container, a <div> with the class page-header is used to display the header of the page, containing the title "Heatmap Layer Proof of Concept" and the subheading "Datasets".
The navigation bar is created using an unordered list (<ul>) with the class nav nav-pills.
Each list item (<li>) represents a navigation option, and the class active is added to the "Manage Datasets" item to indicate the current page.
A space is added using an empty <p> element (<p>&nbsp;</p>).
A button with the class btn btn-primary and a glyphicon is included, allowing users to add a new dataset.
Another space is added using an empty <p> element (<p>&nbsp;</p>).
A <table> with the class table table-hover is used to display a list of datasets.
The <thead> section defines the table headers: "Dataset," "Description," "Date Added," and "Functions."
The <tbody> section contains the data rows of the table, with each dataset represented as a row (<tr>).
The dataset information is provided in individual <td> elements: name, description, date added, and function buttons.
The function buttons include "Edit" and "Delete" options represented as <button> elements with appropriate classes (btn btn-default and btn btn-danger).
The closing tags (</div>, </body>, </html>) complete the HTML structure.
Overall, this HTML code sets up a dashboard interface for managing datasets, displaying them in a table format with options to add, edit, and delete datasets.
